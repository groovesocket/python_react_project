# Python & React Project

## Build an app using the following technologies:
*Front End:* React<br>
*Server side:* Python & Django Rest Framework<br>
*Database:* SQLite

## The Project:  
- Use the baseball data API from Sample APIs (https://sampleapis.com/api-list/baseball).  
- The UI will be simple: List out the players along with their stats from the API (correct the missing data on ranking in terms of hits per season).  
- When a user clicks on a player in the list, they should see a description of the player. 
  - This description should be LLM-generated. 
- Include an Edit button on the UI enabling a user to edit a playerâ€™s data.
